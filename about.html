    <h1 class="text-primary">About Us</h1>
    <p>Vanio Papadelli and Tania Batzoglou are two Greek London-based female artists collaborating since 2012. Their work experiments within different mediums to create physically and emotionally intense performances through intimacy and provocation. It fuses everyday and abstract speech, intense physicality, site-sensitive use of the space, and video, resulting into an unusual mix of theatre, dance and live art.</p>

    <p>Vanio Papadelli is a performer and maker in the fields of movement and physical theatre inspired by Eastern European Laboratory theatre, dance theatre, Contact Improvisation, release-based techniques, somatic movement, and improvisation. She has performed nationally and internationally in work by diverse theatre directors and choreographers including Theatre Lab, Angela Woodhouse, and the award-winning Song of the Goat Theatre. Her performances have travelled in Greece, Beirut, Egypt, and the UK. Vanio is a regular Visiting Lecturer on BA and MA level (Goldsmiths, Rose Bruford College, Middlesex University and LAMDA).</p>

    <p>Tania Batzoglou is an actor, performance artist, storyteller and a drama and movement therapist. She also teaches on performance skills and dramatherapy in Higher Education across the MA courses at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, ArtsEd, and internationally at LISPA -Berlin, University of Belgrade, Hydrama through Ryarson University of Canada; and at the Summer School of Tallinn University, Estonia. In parallel, she works with young people and senior citizens commissioned by the V&amp;A Museum, Historical Royal Palaces, GLYPT and Discover.</p>

    <p>They have both completed practice as research PhDs and they enjoy a heart-to-heart chat as much as an academic debate.</p>
