    <h1 class="text-primary">Outline</h1>
    
    <p>We will work towards “attunement” between body and voice while drawing on emotions
    and imagination. We will explore techniques from physical theatre, somatic movement, partnering work, Integrative Performance Practice and the Sesame approach to dramatherapy to awaken our senses, our expressive mediums and a grounded sense of presence. Tales and myths, rich with symbolic and archetypal dimensions, will inspire us to combine movement with text in creating poetic worlds for the stage.</p>

    <p>The work will create a strong basis for tuning with our senses, spontaneous response
    to impulses, physical and emotional awareness, and uninhibited communication with the partner and the group. Through the exploration of different rhythms and tonalities, we will be able to move from lightness and subtlety to a more dynamic and ‘dense’ expression. We will be able to expand our movement, vocal and acting range by taking creative risks, and experiencing feelings of connectedness.</p>
