            <p style="color:white"> <i>Tania is of earth, the colour of ceramic. An old amulet buried in an ancient spring. If she were a body part she would be eyes that know how to listen. She is Electra, Antigone or Medea who scream the truth and never rest. Tania is a patchwork made of real women, men, children, fools, stories from the East, African, gypsy and Latin stories with alchemists, witches and other shameless and uncensored characters.</i></p>

            <p style="color:white"> <i>Vanio is a white lacy dress closed up to the neck, her fair hair loose, with seashells hidden among them. Her skin transparent. Vanio is water. Dewdrops rippling out of the pages of a romantic novelâ€¦unfolding and dancing. Her strong hands sculpt the air. Vanio is a water nymph, hiding in the wetlands and wherever her gaze lands, white lilies blossom. Kore as if another Persephone.</i></p>
