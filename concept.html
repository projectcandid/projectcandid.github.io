    <p>CANDID is a collaborative project between Tania Batzoglou and Vanio Papadelli that deals with long-lasting female friendships. It was born out of various common life and work experiences that generated shared references but also potential seeds of competition. Through at times relaxed chats and at times bloody emotional conversations, we decided to create a project that will document the way our relationship evolves over the years. We proposed what many may consider a utopian commitment: to repeat our project at least once a year, like a life-long performance ritual or a durational “truth or dare” game. We're doing very well so far, having performed 5 different iterations of CANDID since 2013. The rules of the “game” change slightly or drastically depending on the space we’re performing, the material we may choose to integrate and reproduce from previous versions, and our desire to experiment with different aesthetic forms and mediums.</p>

    <p>CANDID is a project that questions and deconstructs issues of friendship, identity, transience and commitment, at times as a shout at times as a subtle allusion. How can a friendship survive and last within a culture of ‘Temp’, ‘Insta-friends’ and ‘frenemies’? Is friendship an urgent antidote to growing phenomena of trolling and feelings of isolation or ‘selfie’ practices? Can female friendship be reimagined as a creative, intelligent and inquisitive practice that defies stereotypes of girly attitudes and ridicules “catfight” behaviours?</p>
     
    <p>CANDID is a performed collage of our friendship and of other women we’ve met, sensed, imagined, read or heard about, which will keep growing and gaining layers of complexity. It draws material from our ten-year experience of living in the UK coloured by our common Greek identities. Often feeling exiled in the vastness of London, we felt that working together allows us to return to a Mediterranean uncensored sea of emotions without politeness. To be absurd, ridiculous, vulnerable, candid, nostalgic, intelligent and honest with each other as a way of staying together.</p>
     
    <p>Our performances have been described as a totally unusual and unique mix of theatre, dance and live art that cannot easily be classified under existing genres. CANDID is an ‘umbrella’ project that also integrates intergenerational workshops and community events, which enable us to collect new and question our devising material but equally offers artistic tools and a platform for discussing friendship with various groups of people.</p>
