    <p>Are you real or mythical? I re-imagine, admire and objectify you. I want to pull your hair out. Friend, poor friend. I want to ignore and humiliate you. Then, I want to take you by your hand and go out in the fields. Spend time with you, laugh and say silly things.</p>

    <p>CANDID is an enigmatic ‘performance-ritual’ that celebrates long lasting friendships. A dangerous ‘truth or dare’ game that weaves the stories of two women. Together, they remember, deconstruct and reinvent themselves.</p>

    <p>When they come face to face, each one is reflected in the eyes, body and words of the other by unveiling and blending memories from previous relationships that might be real, mythical or imaginary. Continuous comparisons, dark thoughts, conflicts, and fears surge and evolve as they grow and change. Through candid confrontations, the two friends uncover their need to be identical and yet different; to merge into each other and, at the same time, to be superior. Their mutual candour brings them face-to-face; and that is what keeps them connected. </p>

    <p>Candid is a performance about female relationships that we experience, observe and imagine around us. Through abstract and everyday dialogue and physicality, it questions issues of competition among women, difference and commitment explored in a raw, confessional, confrontational and vulnerable manner. Vanio and Tania, the two friends, have committed to repeat this game at least once a year, giving to the performance the dimensions of a life-long ritual.</p>

    <p>The piece has travelled and been adapted so far into black boxes, galleries, houses and a council chamber, every time changing its rules.</p>
