    <p>Are you real or mythical? I re-imagine, admire and objectify you. I want to pull your hair out. Friend, poor friend. I want to ignore and humiliate you. Then, I want to take you by your hand and go out in the fields. Spend time with you, laugh and say silly things.</p>

    <p>CANDID is an enigmatic ‘performance-ritual’ that celebrates long lasting friendships. A dangerous ‘truth or dare’ game that weaves the stories of two women. Together, they remember, deconstruct and reinvent themselves.</p>

    <p>When they come face to face, each one is reflected in the eyes, body and words of the other by unveiling and blending memories from previous relationships that might be real, mythical or imaginary. Continuous comparisons, dark thoughts, conflicts, and fears surge and evolve as they grow and change. Through candid confrontations, the two friends uncover their need to be identical and yet different; to merge into each other and, at the same time, to be superior. Their mutual candour brings them face-to-face; and that is what keeps them connected. </p>

    <p>Candid is a performance about female relationships that we experience, observe and imagine around us. Through abstract and everyday dialogue and physicality, it questions issues of competition among women, difference and commitment explored in a raw, confessional, confrontational and vulnerable manner. Vanio and Tania, the two friends, have committed to repeat this game at least once a year, giving to the performance the dimensions of a life-long ritual.</p>

    <p>The piece has travelled and been adapted so far into black boxes, galleries, houses and a council chamber, every time changing its rules.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Unusual and hilarious, with both actors equally talented, this piece nicely overdid Greek drama to portray the ancient themes of love and hate that can arise between – clearly female – friends</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>One of the most unforgettable performances of this past season[...] The two Greek performers […] undergo a series of spontaneous transformations in front of your very eyes, pushing into each other with the ravenous hunger of discovery that later drives them apart. […] “Candid” takes that early sense of complete identification and rolls it around its tongue in a cascade of poetry that sounds totally mysterious and utterly familiar all at once. Building a dramatic landscape of highs and lows, the two actresses hold their audiences captive, […] to communicate what keeps them together and rips them apart.</p>

      <p>How vital Candid was! Created and performed by Vanio Papadelli and Tania Batzoglou, two beautifully strong Greek women</p>

      <p>I loved Candid …tender in the beginning, then dependent and demanding and finally true, natural, brutal...</p>
