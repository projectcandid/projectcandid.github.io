    <p>The CANDID-ettes are taking over the Blue Elephant Theatre for one night of interactive installation and performance on Wednesday the 14th of December! 
    Fruit and silver costumes will change the colour of CANDID, in this totally re-worked and longer version with a festive twist. The CANDID-ettes are not alone this time; be prepared to see them interacting with a tiny secret guest star. And they're delighted to have included in their team two wonderful artists, the visual artist/designer Moi Tran as well as the lighting designer Yianni Katsaris, who is also in charge of the documentation of the show.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the Blue Elephant theatre, the CANDID-ettes will remain faithful to their promise, to perform CANDID at least once every year, just on the cusp of 2016!</p>

    <p>Doors open from 19.30.</p>

    <p>Come along and bring your friends! There will be fruit, tea and mulled wine in the foyer!
